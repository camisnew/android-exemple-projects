# Android Exemple Projects
Repo with android simple (or not that much) exercises.

### Layout Exercise App (aka MyApplication)
This exercise mostly trains the hability to work with Android XML and internalization. As bonus it has some basic button functions like navigate through pages. This also made me realize how to work with personalized landscapes.
- done

Including vibrating, dialing, calling (dangerous permission), opening browser, sharing text or images.
